The last date of the night
Checkmate in the rain
You're gaining the upper hand and you're telling me
That it's not a good idea
But I want it

404, black screen
It's laughable, you thought you had me
Have a safe trip, you fool!
Those are my only compliments at the other end of the line
Aimlessly and sober
Like being taken in the opposite direction
Barefoot on the Milky Way
Of this disillusioned night
My silence lights up our journey
And your illusions trace the landscape

404, black screen
It's laughable, you thought you had me
Have a safe trip, you fool!
Those are my only compliments at the other end of the line

404, black screen
It's laughable, you thought you had me
Have a safe trip, you fool!
Those are my only compliments at the other end of the line
404, black screen
It's laughable, you thought you had me
Have a safe trip, you fool!
Those are my only compliments at the other end of the line
