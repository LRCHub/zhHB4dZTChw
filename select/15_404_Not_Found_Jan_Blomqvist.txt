We're all here
Because we're holding our own
But there just under
We're living on a rock

Tilted, spinning around
Just gravity holding us
Here above
A straight road out

We're all clear to land
But far from our home
We're not stressing
Of never having enough

Here, we take the brighter side
Of all the things corrupt
From here above
A straight road curves around
